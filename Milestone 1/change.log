Change log of requirement-interview.docx


v2
=====================

- some problems are swapped so that they could be adjacently related
- beautified some wordings in problems
- added/modified functional requirements

Suggestions:
- modify the Problem 10
    From: Find it difficult to adapt the new teaching style or find out what is required of the course
      To: Uncertain about which UST Hall is the best, e.g. having the most exciting activity
          (or something else)
  since the original problem is too broad, in my opinion.
  I could hardly think any possible / practical solution to solve it.

IMPORTANT:
- REMEMBER to add your name in this file
