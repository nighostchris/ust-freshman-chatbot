## Thanksgiving Party

After half semester your freshmen friends seems learned a lot from statistics class, because they keep talking about mean and SD. Your team decided to have a thanksgiving party to cheer them up (this year thanksgiving is on 23rd Nov, btw). Freshmen are invited to this party and they will need to bring some snack food. Your team is going to complete the following things with your chatbot. If the freshmen are happy they can do well in the final and some group in COMP3111 will also receive more points.

> All freshmen users will receive a thanksgiving party invitation poster in the chatbot daily (from 21 to 27 of Nov <-- for us to grade) until the user type "accept". Then he will need to enter what party snack he will bring. The bot replies either "1) Great, please prepare 5 people portion of that". or "2) Someone is bringing that already, can you pick another one?" (reply this if some other people pick that food already). One day before the party a reminder should be sent to all people who is going.

For H-group you will need to allow an admin to upload the poster via LINE directly, with a special command that only avaliable to particular account. For non H-group, you can simply place the poster image as a static resource.
